#include<bits/stdc++.h>
//<bits/stdc++.h> contains mostly all the libraries so if we include this library alone in our program there is no need of importing multiple libraries again and again.
using namespace std;
// by using namespace we do not need to write std again and again it std by default to all functions.
int main(){
    int x,y,z;
    cin >> x;

    cout << "Value of x:- " << x << endl;
    cout << "Value of y:- " << y  << endl << "and z:- " << z;
